# Hackademy

Hello! This is my bootcamp's current repository where I'll be uploading my exercises' resolutions and other stuff, maybe even notes. 
Hope this helps anyone who might be interested in enhancing their programming skills or maybe just being curious on what the bootcamp's about.

The two main directories contain the following:
- Hackademy: The resolution to the exercises so far in Java, main project made with IntelliJ Idea divided in packages. 
- pseint: Pseudocode exercises solved using PSeint.
